What is Minion ?
################

Minion is developed as an open source project by the Mozilla Security Assurance team and improved
by Frédéric Guégan apprentice at Orange Digital Factory.
The goal is to enable developers and security testers to bring web application security
into a continuous testing cycle. To do this, both developers and testers are given an
easy to use dashboard that lists all the sites they need to scan, detail scan summary page
and detail issue page to explain vulnerability. Instead of learning a new scan tool,
users can write Minion plugins to call their favorite scan tools, and Minion will spawn
the tool as a new process, scan the target website, and return the results back to the user.
